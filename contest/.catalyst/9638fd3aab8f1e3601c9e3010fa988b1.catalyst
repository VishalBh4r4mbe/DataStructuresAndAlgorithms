For example, for $$$3$$$ or $$$5$$$ donuts you&apos;ll have to buy a box of $$$10$$$ donuts for $$$4$$$ dollars. $$$3$$$ or $$$5$$$ donuts in the first shop would cost you $$$15$$$ or $$$25$$$ dollars, respectively, however. For $$$20$$$ donuts you&apos;ll have to buy two boxes for $$$8$$$ dollars total. Note that $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ are also valid answers for the second shop, along with many other answers.</p><p>In the second testcase buying any number of donuts will be either cheaper in the first shop or the same price. $$$8$$$ donuts cost $$$32$$$ dollars in the first shop and $$$40$$$ dollars in the second shop (because you have to buy two boxes). $$$10$$$ donuts will cost $$$40$$$ dollars in both shops, so $$$10$$$ is not a valid answer for any of the shops.</p><p>In the third testcase $$$1$$$ donut costs $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ dollars, respectively. $$$2$$$ donuts cost $$$4$$$ and $$$3$$$ dollars. Thus, $$$1$$$ is a valid answer for the first shop and $$$2$$$ is a valid answer for the second shop.</p><p>In the fourth testcase $$$10^9$$$ donuts cost $$$10^{18}$$$ dollars in the first shop and $$$10^9$$$ dollars in the second shop.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1611989823549,"input":"4\n5 10 4\n4 5 20\n2 2 3\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n","output":"-1 20\n8 -1\n1 2\n-1 1000000000\n","result":{"id":1611989823549,"stdout":"-1 10\r\n1 -1\r\n1 2\r\n-1 1000000000\r\n","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":17,"timeout":false}}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++","langId":"54"}
