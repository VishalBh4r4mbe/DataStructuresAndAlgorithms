The $$$i$$$-th operation allows you to swap elements of the given permutation on positions $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Each operation can be performed at most once</span>. The operations can be performed in arbitrary order.</p><p>Your task is to find the lexicographically minimum possible permutation obtained by performing some of the given operations in some order.</p><p>You can see the definition of the lexicographical order in the notes section.</p><p>You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent test cases.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s consider the permutation $$$[5, 4, 1, 3, 2]$$$.
