He can only pull the box if he stands <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$1$$$ unit away from the box in the direction of one of two coordinate axes.

In this case, it is not necessary for him to be in exactly $$$1$$$ unit away from the box. If he wants to pull the box again, he must return to a point next to the box. Also, Wabbit can&apos;t move to the point where the box is located.</p><p>Wabbit can start at any point. It takes $$$1$$$ second to travel $$$1$$$ unit right, left, up, or down, regardless of whether he pulls the box while moving.</p><p>Determine the minimum amount of time he needs to move the box from $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$ to $$$(x_2,y_2)$$$. Note that the point where Wabbit ends up at does not matter.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.

He pulls the box to $$$(2,1)$$$ while moving to $$$(3,1)$$$. He then moves to $$$(3,2)$$$ and then to $$$(2,2)$$$ without pulling the box.
