Of course, Masha wants her ad to be seen by as many people as possible. Therefore, she must hire bloggers with the maximum total number of followers.</p><p>Help her, find the number of ways to select $$$k$$$ bloggers so that the total number of their followers is maximum possible. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one blogger in the first way, which is not in the second way.
