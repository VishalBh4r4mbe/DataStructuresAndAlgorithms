Baby Ehab Plays with Permutations","contestId":"1516","problemIndex":"E","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>This time around, Baby Ehab will play with permutations. He has $$$n$$$ cubes arranged in a row, with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ written on them. He&apos;ll make <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$j$$$ operations. In each operation, he&apos;ll pick up $$$2$$$ cubes and switch their positions.</p><p>He&apos;s wondering: how many different sequences of cubes can I have at the end? Since Baby Ehab is a turbulent person, he doesn&apos;t know how many operations he&apos;ll make, so he wants the answer for every possible $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The only line contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 200$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of cubes Baby Ehab has, and the parameter $$$k$$$ from the statement.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print $$$k$$$ space-separated integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them is the number of possible sequences you can end up with if you do exactly $$$i$$$ operations. Since this number can be very large, print the remainder when it&apos;s divided by $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the second example, there are $$$3$$$ sequences he can get after $$$1$$$ swap, because there are $$$3$$$ pairs of cubes he can swap.
