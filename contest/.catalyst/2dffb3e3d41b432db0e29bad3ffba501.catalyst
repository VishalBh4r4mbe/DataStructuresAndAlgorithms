Due to the landform and the clouds, he cannot fly too high or too low. Formally, let $$$b_i$$$ be the height of Wowo&apos;s aircraft at checkpoint $$$i$$$, $$$x_i^-\\le b_i\\le x_i^+$$$ should be satisfied for all integers $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, where $$$x_i^-$$$ and $$$x_i^+$$$ are given integers.</p><p>The angle of Wowo&apos;s aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a $$$90$$$-degree climb. Formally, $$$y_i^-\\le b_i-b_{i-1}\\le y_i^+$$$ should be satisfied for all integers $$$i$$$ between $$$2$$$ and $$$n$$$, where $$$y_i^-$$$ and $$$y_i^+$$$ are given integers.</p><p>The final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns. Formally, $$$z_i^- \\le (b_i - b_{i-1}) - (b_{i-1} - b_{i-2}) \\le z_i^+$$$ should be satisfied for all integers $$$i$$$ between $$$3$$$ and $$$n$$$, where $$$z_i^-$$$ and $$$z_i^+$$$ are given integers.</p><p>Taking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose.
