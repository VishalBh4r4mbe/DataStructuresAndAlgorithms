He has solved plenty of such problems, but according to Warawreh, in order to graduate from university he has to solve more graph problems. Since Salem is not good with graphs he asked your help with the following problem.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/45b3f2196a96173e2055c4f8f02643d7d0a00437.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center><p>You are given a complete directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices without self-loops. In other words, you have $$$n$$$ vertices and each pair of vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$u \\neq v$$$) has both directed edges $$$(u, v)$$$ and $$$(v, u)$$$.</p><p>Every directed edge of the graph is labeled with a single character: either &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&apos; or &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>&apos; (edges $$$(u, v)$$$ and $$$(v, u)$$$ may have different labels).</p><p>You are also given an integer $$$m &gt; 0$$$. You should find a path of length $$$m$$$ such that the string obtained by writing out edges&apos; labels when going along the path is a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">palindrome</span>.
