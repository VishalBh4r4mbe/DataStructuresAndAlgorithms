Baby Ehab Partitions Again","contestId":"1516","problemIndex":"C","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Baby Ehab was toying around with arrays. He has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He defines an array to be good if there&apos;s no way to partition it into $$$2$$$ subsequences such that the sum of the elements in the first is equal to the sum of the elements in the second. Now he wants to remove the minimum number of elements in $$$a$$$ so that it becomes a good array. Can you help him?</p><p>A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the array $$$a$$$.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the elements of the array $$$a$$$.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>The first line should contain the minimum number of elements you need to remove.</p><p>The second line should contain the indices of the elements you&apos;re removing, separated by spaces.</p><p>We can show that an answer always exists.
