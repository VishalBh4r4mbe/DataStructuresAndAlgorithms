Polycarp and Div 3","contestId":"1005","problemIndex":"D","timeLimit":"3 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Polycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3.</p><p>He has a huge number $$$s$$$. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $$$3$$$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $$$m$$$ such cuts, there will be $$$m+1$$$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $$$3$$$.</p><p>For example, if the original number is $$$s=3121$$$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $$$3|1|21$$$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $$$3$$$.</p><p>Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> if and only if this number is exactly one character &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>&apos;). For example, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">007</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">01</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00099</span> are not valid numbers, but <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">90</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10001</span> are valid.</p><p>What is the maximum number of numbers divisible by $$$3$$$ that Polycarp can obtain?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains a positive integer $$$s$$$.
