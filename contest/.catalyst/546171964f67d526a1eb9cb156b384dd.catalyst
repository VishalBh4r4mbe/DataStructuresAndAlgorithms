Marty suggested Joe to generate a string of length $$$n$$$ to entertain him somehow. It didn&apos;t seem particularly difficult, but Joe&apos;s generated string had to follow these rules:</p><ul> <li> the string may only contain characters &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>&apos;, or &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>&apos;; </li><li> the maximum length of a substring of this string that is a palindrome does not exceed $$$k$$$. </li></ul><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/10d6acb7a5a08122f364198611f17101e3601362.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center><p>A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. For example, strings &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bc</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>&quot; are substrings of a string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>&quot;, while strings &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ac</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cba</span>&quot; are not.</p><p>A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, strings &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abccba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abbba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abacaba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bacab</span>&quot; are palindromes, while strings &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abcbba</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abb</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ab</span>&quot; are not.</p><p>Now Joe wants to find any correct string. Help him! It can be proven that the answer always exists under the given constraints.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10$$$).</p><p>The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 1\\,000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the required string length and the maximum length of a palindrome substring, respectively.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>For each test case, print any string that satisfies the conditions from the problem statement.
