In one minute Masha can pick one arbitrary stick and increase its length by one centimeter. She is not allowed to break sticks.</p><p>What is the minimum number of minutes she needs to spend increasing the stick&apos;s length in order to be able to assemble a triangle of positive area. Sticks should be used as triangle&apos;s sides (one stick for one side) and their endpoints should be located at triangle&apos;s vertices.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The only line contains tree integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 100$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the lengths of sticks Masha possesses.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print a single integer&#xA0;&#x2014; the minimum number of minutes that Masha needs to spend in order to be able to make the triangle of positive area from her sticks.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example, Masha can make a triangle from the sticks without increasing the length of any of them.</p><p>In the second example, Masha can&apos;t make a triangle of positive area from the sticks she has at the beginning, but she can spend one minute to increase the length $$$2$$$ centimeter stick by one and after that form a triangle with sides $$$3$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ centimeters.</p><p>In the third example, Masha can take $$$33$$$ minutes to increase one of the $$$10$$$ centimeters sticks by $$$33$$$ centimeters, and after that take $$$48$$$ minutes to increase another $$$10$$$ centimeters stick by $$$48$$$ centimeters. This way she can form a triangle with lengths $$$43$$$, $$$58$$$ and $$$100$$$ centimeters in $$$81$$$ minutes. One can show that it is impossible to get a valid triangle faster.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1612847466599,"input":"3 4 5\n","output":"0\n","result":{"id":1612847466599,"stdout":"0","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":20,"timeout":false}},{"id":1612847466600,"input":"2 5 3\n","output":"1\n","result":{"id":1612847466600,"stdout":"1","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":18,"timeout":false}},{"id":1612847466601,"input":"100 10 10\n","output":"81\n","result":{"id":1612847466601,"stdout":"81","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":17,"timeout":false}}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++","langId":"54"}
