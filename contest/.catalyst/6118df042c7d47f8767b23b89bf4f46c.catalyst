The directions are given by a string of $$$n$$$ characters such that each character is either <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>. If the $$$i$$$-th character is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>, it means that the $$$i$$$-th road initially goes from the city $$$i$$$ to the city $$$i - 1$$$; otherwise it goes from the city $$$i - 1$$$ to the city $$$i$$$.</p><p>A traveler would like to visit as many cities of this country as possible. Initially, they will choose some city to start their journey from. Each day, the traveler <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">must</span> go from the city where they currently are to a neighboring city using one of the roads, and they can go along a road only if it is directed in the same direction they are going; i.&#x2009;e., if a road is directed from city $$$i$$$ to the city $$$i + 1$$$, it is possible to travel from $$$i$$$ to $$$i + 1$$$, but not from $$$i + 1$$$ to $$$i$$$. After the traveler moves to a neighboring city, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> roads change their directions <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">to the opposite ones</span>. If the traveler cannot go from their current city to a neighboring city, their journey ends; it is also possible to end the journey whenever the traveler wants to.</p><p>The goal of the traveler is to visit as many different cities as possible (they can visit a city multiple times, but only the first visit is counted).
