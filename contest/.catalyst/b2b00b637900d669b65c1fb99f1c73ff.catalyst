The $$$n$$$ vertices of the tree corresponds to the $$$n$$$ volunteers and are numbered by $$$1,2,\\ldots, n$$$.</p><p>We define the distance between two volunteers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, <span class=\"tex-font-style-rm\">dis</span>$$$(i,j)$$$ as the number of edges on the shortest path from vertex $$$i$$$ to vertex $$$j$$$ on the tree. <span class=\"tex-font-style-rm\">dis</span>$$$(i,j)=0$$$ whenever $$$i=j$$$.</p><p>Some of the volunteers can attend the on-site reunion while others cannot. If for some volunteer $$$x$$$ and nonnegative integer $$$r$$$, all volunteers whose distance to $$$x$$$ is no more than $$$r$$$ can attend the on-site reunion, a forum with radius $$$r$$$ can take place. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">level</span> of the on-site reunion is defined as the maximum possible radius of any forum that can take place.</p><p>Assume that each volunteer can attend the on-site reunion with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ and these events are independent.
