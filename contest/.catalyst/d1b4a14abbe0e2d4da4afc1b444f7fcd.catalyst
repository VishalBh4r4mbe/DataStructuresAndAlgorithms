He starts with a piece of paper with an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ written on it, and then he does the following:</p><ul> <li> he picks a range $$$(l, r)$$$ and cuts the subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ out, removing the rest of the array. </li><li> he then cuts this range into multiple subranges. </li><li> to add a number theory spice to it, he requires that the elements of every subrange must have their product equal to their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple\">least common multiple (LCM)</a>. </li></ul><p>Formally, he partitions the elements of $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ into contiguous subarrays such that the product of every subarray is equal to its LCM. Now, for $$$q$$$ independent ranges $$$(l, r)$$$, tell Baby Ehab the minimum number of subarrays he needs.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,q \\le 10^5$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.</p><p>The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the elements of the array $$$a$$$.</p><p>Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the endpoints of this query&apos;s interval.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>For each query, print its answer on a new line.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>The first query asks about the whole array.
