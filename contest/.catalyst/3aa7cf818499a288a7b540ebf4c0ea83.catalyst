To establish his power to the neighbouring kingdoms he wants to marry his daughters to the princes of these kingdoms. As a lucky coincidence there are $$$n$$$ other kingdoms as well.</p><p>So Polycarp LXXXIV has enumerated his daughters from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the kingdoms from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For each daughter he has compiled a list of kingdoms princes of which she wanted to marry.</p><p>Polycarp LXXXIV is very busy, so he finds a couple for his daughters greedily one after another.</p><p>For the first daughter he takes <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the kingdom with the lowest number from her list</span> and marries the daughter to their prince. For the second daughter he takes <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the kingdom with the lowest number from her list, prince of which hasn&apos;t been taken already</span>. If there are no free princes in the list then the daughter marries nobody and Polycarp LXXXIV proceeds to the next daughter. The process ends after the $$$n$$$-th daughter.</p><p>For example, let there be $$$4$$$ daughters and kingdoms, the lists daughters have are $$$[2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 4]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, respectively.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7d068fb670cc0ee02169fa666a0b4121fa7feb9a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center><p>In that case daughter $$$1$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$2$$$, daughter $$$2$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$1$$$, daughter $$$3$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$3$$$, leaving daughter $$$4$$$ nobody to marry to.</p><p>Actually, before starting the marriage process Polycarp LXXXIV has the time to convince one of his daughters that some prince is also worth marrying to.
