The first line should contain a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 11$$$) &#x2014; the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le m$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the color of the $$$i$$$-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them.
